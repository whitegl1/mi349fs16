      <p class="classy"> Other thing I did today. Hooked up Raspberry Pi to same network. Unfortunately our
        relay server was using the IP address instead of the FQDN. This caused me to have to go through
        several /bin/ directorys to find said config file to change. Once it was changed I then had to do stupid
        linux commands for permissions on the file. Once that was done it worked!
