        <p>Hello, my name is Glenn M. White, I am a senior at Michigan State University
          and I will be finished with my undergraduate this December.
          I am 25 years old and took a year off from school a few years ago
          and started my own IT Consulting company. While my Web Design experience
          is very limited I have a much deeper knowledge infrastructure, and look forward to learning more
          about Web Design and Development!
        </p>
